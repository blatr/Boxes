              <a href="http://www.youdo.co.nz/">YouDo</a> is a New Zealand owned software company based in Wellington.

              Since then we have built ground up systems for Powershop, Orange Umbrella, Open Data Model, Carbon Match and Flick Electric to name a few. Along the way we created a pile of in-house products…two of which actually have paying customers.
