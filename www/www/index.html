            <p>
              <a href="http://www.youdo.co.nz/">YouDo</a> is a New Zealand owned software company based in Wellington. It was founded in 2007 by three completely naïve individuals who believed it was possible to deliver high quality software efficiently and effectively using Ruby on Rails and Scrum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then we have built ground up systems for Powershop, Orange Umbrella, Open Data Model, Carbon Match and Flick Electric to name a few. Along the way we created a pile of in-house products…two of which actually have paying customers.
